# ðŸŒ™ Lunapapa's GitHub Profile

Hello, I'm Lunapapa, an enthusiastic Erasmus Mundus student currently immersed in the [EDISS program](https://www.master-ediss.eu/) at [Abo Akademi University](https://www.abo.fi/en/). As a part-time research assistant in a maritime robotics program under the supervision of [Sebastien Lafond](https://research.abo.fi/en/persons/sebastien-lafond), I am dedicated to advancing my knowledge in this fascinating field.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic and Professional Journey

I kickstarted my academic journey by earning my initial master's degree in Information Technology with distinction from [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/comp/) in 2013. Following this accomplishment, I ventured into the corporate landscape, contributing my skills to renowned multinational corporations. Notable roles include serving as a [CoE](https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/ccoe.html) and Field consultant at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/) from 2013 to 2016. Subsequently, I took on the responsibilities of an industrial consulting manager at [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/ao/en/about/our-businesses/capital-incubator-group) from 2016 to 2018. In 2018, I co-founded an e-commerce startup in the Philippines. However, by the end of 2018, my focus shifted to the significant role of raising my daughter Luna, who is now two years old.

Recently, I made the decision to re-enter academia. Since the autumn of 2023, I have been diligently pursuing my second master's degree in the [EDISS program](https://www.master-ediss.eu/). The first year of this endeavor is being completed at [Abo Akademi University](https://www.abo.fi/en/) in Finland, with the second year scheduled at [University of L'Aquila](https://www.univaq.it/en/) in Italy.
